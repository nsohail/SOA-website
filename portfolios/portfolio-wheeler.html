								  <p><span>Major</span>  Art and Visual Technology (Graphic Design)</p>

							  </div>
							   <p>I am currently finishing up my BFA in Graphic Design at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. I’ve done work as a freelancer, in addition to my studies, creating logos, stationery and other projects for local organizations and startup businesses. However, my passion lies in the art of stationery and hand lettering. While studying in a design world dictated by the computer, I tend to spin my projects in a way that allows me to include some hand-drawn elements, whether it be an illustration or hand-lettered, typographical pieces. I believe this adds more personality to each piece, while increasing visual interest with subtle texture that can be highlighted and complemented with color and patterns.  
                               <p>My eventual goal is to take this handmade aesthetic into my stationery business. I want to encourage others to return to letter-writing, to connect with people on a deeper level than can be reached through e-mail or private messaging. I want to do this in a way that is attractive to people, in quality and in design. I would like my work to be seen as a thoughtful gift and a piece of art. I am not disinterested in design at the corporate level, as the visual improvements designers make at that level should also be commended, but my focus lies on a level that can be experienced by more people. 
                               <p>My senior project, while it does not focus on stationery or hand lettering, it does connect to community and culture. I created a book that merges design, music and building up of community through getting to learn about others on a personal level. This book, titled <i>The Duskwhales</i>, is about a local DC band, their music and their story. I have a background in music and really wanted to incorporate that aspect of my life into my book. I believe that combining two of my passions into one project yields creative results. 
                               <p>I want people to learn about this band on a deeper level than just their music. It is meant to be more informational and insightful, rather than entertaining. The entertainment factor can come from the music and their performances, but this book serves as an enhancement of their identity as a band. After reading this book, readers should end up with a better idea of the history and the making of the band, as well as the purpose of their songs and lyrics. Readers will also get a glance into the personality of the band as a whole, as well as the personality and story of each member as an individual musician. 
                               <p>I worked with the band to produce content that serves this purpose of the final book and created a piece that is in line with the visual and musical aesthetic of The Duskwhales. I really wanted this to be something that family and friends of the band would still find informational and also something that would intrigue new and potential listeners.</p>
