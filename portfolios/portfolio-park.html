There is no doubt that my hardware is made in Korea, but in my identity, there are a few software of the U.S. installed. For example, Americans’ free mind, which I would like to call individualism, has been installed in me who was born with collectivism. I had never known that I had a very tough life in Korea. In Korean collectivism, they care for each other too much and even they interfere in each other’s life. And, they call it as sort of “kindness” and “care”. I had thought Korean collectivism was the best thing in the world. After getting out of a well, I could see further and deeper. In the U.S., there was not only individualism, but also there was collectivism! I just realized that I had too narrow of a vision about the world. Seeing is believing. Experiencing is knowing.                                <p>That has affected my religious views. When I was young, I thought that Christianity always stopped me from enjoying my life. That made me feel uncomfortable choosing between Christ and the World. These were silly and stupid thoughts. As I said above, experiencing is knowing. Since I began to read the Bible, my perspective has been changed. As a Christian, I can enjoy my life! I had never known of the truth because I did not listen to and did not experience the God in the Bible. Most people believe that Christians are conservative and unadaptable. However, I would like to say that if you really read what the Bible says, you must know who God is. “(John 8:12) Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”...and this is my story.                                 <p>In my book, I would like to tell readers what I know about the Bible. But, this book is not a formal religious book. It is like storytelling and a narrative book based on my personal interpretation of the Bible. It does not matter whether you are Christian or not. I just want people to know more about the Bible through my story. I do not address everything written in the Bible, but I focus on a few stories such as stories of Jesus, Genesis, Moses, and others. So after reading this book, I would like the readers to see what I interpret and what I believe in.</p>											   							</div>																			</div>											</div>					</div>								</div> 			     	  </div>   </div>         <!--=============== section contacts ===============-->	<div id="contacts" class="sections">		<div class="content">			<div class="quote-icon to-top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up"></i></div>									<!--map-->			<div class="mapbox">				<div class="map-decor"></div>				<div class="close-map"><img src="images/close-white.png" alt=""><div class="triangle"></div></div>				<div id="map_canvas"></div>			</div>							<!-- footer -->					<div class="footer clear">							<p>Cashemir  ©2014  All rights reserved.</p>				<div class="small-separator ws"></div>							</div> <!--footer end-->					</div>	</div><!--=============== section contacts end ===============-->			</div> <!--=============== wrapper end ===============-->		</div><!--=============== main end ===============-->	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.min.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jpreloader.min.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/smoothscroll.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.easing.1.3.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/superslides.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/mixitup.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" defer src="../js/jquery.flexslider.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.parallax-1.1.3.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.scrollTo-1.4.2-min.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/hoverdir.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/owl.carousel.min.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/appear.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.nav.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/fitvids.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.lavalamp.min.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script>	<script>	$(document).ready(function(){		$('.flexslider').flexslider({														animation: "slide",			slideDirection: "horizontal",			slideshow: false,			slideshowSpeed: 3500,			animationDuration: 500,			directionNav: true,			controlNav: true,													});	});	</script></body></html>
