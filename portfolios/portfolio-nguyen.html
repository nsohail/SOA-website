							   <p>Ever since I was small I have loved to draw. I would watch my favorite anime show every Monday and Wednesday afternoon at three. As I watched the show, I began to doodle, and from time to time it turned into complete drawings. Soon my drawings became book covers, CD covers, or many other projects where I could use my drawings to illustrate and tell a story. Craft and book stores are my favorite places to go. I usually can be found in the paper and sketch books aisle. I am always buying notebooks or sketch books just because they feel nice and the design is creative. I have so many, I never used them, just end up collecting them for looks. As I grew older and continued my education, I felt compelled to pursue artwork that was more practical. I fell in love with graphic design the more I learned about it, and with every project I completed. Over time I developed new skills and put them to use, but drawing has always remained my first love. It is my therapy and it is the oxygen that circulates my creativity. It’s how I start every project, digital or otherwise. My favorite subject is the female form. I have found that nothing else in existence exhibits beauty and grace better than the intricate curves and delicate shapes of the female body. My other favorite subject is hair. I am intrigued by the way it shines and illuminates, the highlights and low lights working together to create an organic, twisted composition. I love the unique folds and shadows created by fabric,especially when it’s draped over common objects or on the human body, creating an entirely new way to view texture and shape. My favorite tools to use areball-point pens. I find they translate my ideas into reality better than any other medium I have used so far. My future career as a graphic designer combines everything I love into one neat package. Someone once said that if you work at something you love, you will never work a day in your life. In graphic design, I have found a passion that will sustain me creatively, spiritually and financially. The Book of Beauty and Seduction is an informative book that will give the readers a little insight for some of the familiar names mentioned in mythological texts or through folklore tales. It features female figures from different parts of the world. Each of the figures came from a different background, from the ancient Greek to the ancient Egypt to the far East. Some of the figures are known goddesses, some are known queens, while others are figures from tales that were passed down from generation to generation. The book is not only to inform the readers of who they are and where they originated, but it also showcases these figures that were mentioned in the movies, books or other media as their true forms or reference.</p>
