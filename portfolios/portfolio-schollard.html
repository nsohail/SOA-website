							   <p>I have always had a deep and abiding fascination with patterns that exist in nature, both hidden and apparent. As the foundation for this project I chose to focus on “Cymatics” - the study of sound vibration and the patterns that develop from those vibrations. In 1787, Ernst Chladni, a German physicist and musician, discovered that visible patterns could be created by drawing a violin bow along the edge of a metal plate suspended by a pin and covered with sand. The frequency generated by the bow caused the plate to resonate in such a way that distinct, repeatable patterns were made visible in the sand. The revelation that sound could be made visible in such a manner continues to influence, even today, the design and construction of acoustic instruments. Modern day, commercially-built, Chladni plates are designed to receive pure frequencies from a frequency generator and can create astonishingly clear and surprisingly precise geometric patterns.  Although the overarching theme of this project was to create and investigate the patterning of sounds through vibration, my goal was not to use a single frequency which is typical of other Chladni studies. Instead, I wanted to use the varying frequencies and vibrations generated by a single piece of music and track pattern changes across the entire work. After a couple tries I successfully built my own Chladni plate from an old speaker. The music was played through the speaker and the vibration was then translated to the attached metal plate which was covered with salt. The video documentation is taken directly from the top of the plate as music was being playing through it. My aim was to capture the specific patterns that developed from a single piece of music. That pattern was then translated and interpreted into large scale canvas plates which were then used to create Collagraph prints.  As a printmaker I find myself continuously falling in love with my printing plate, often preferring it to the actual prints themselves. When I began experimenting with the use of canvas as my collagraphic substrate, I set out with the specific intention to consider the canvas printing plate as a piece of art in addition to the final prints produced by such a plate. Each of these canvas plates represents the Cymatic pattern rendered by one song as played through my homemade Chladni plate. I will be completing my BFA in Printmaking with a focus on interdisciplinary work. I am the founder and organizer of the NOVA Printmakers collective and an active member of The Golden Key Society and Phi Kappa Phi honor society.</p>
