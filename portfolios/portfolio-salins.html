							   <p>I will always be a student. Whether I am enrolled in school or not, I want to continue learning for the rest of my life. I hope to eventually go back to school and further my education (maybe in graphic design, maybe in another unknown subject). After graduation, I hope to become more acquainted with other aspects of art and design such as web/coding, illustration, and photography. My biggest goal in life is to be able to make a difference and help others, whether it is in my own family or in the community. I would love to be able to work for a non-profit organization or be a graphic designer for a philanthropic purpose. When I do have spare time, I love to hang out with my friends (this usually involves food) or just kick back and watch Netflix. I am pretty involved with my church and am in charge of planning events and activities, which I really enjoy. When I grow up, I want to have a miniature dachshund and possibly a goat, because they are hilarious. I love playing volleyball at an amateur level and am addicted to most of the apps on my phone. My favorite condiment is hot sauce, and pizza and chicken wings are tied for favorite food. While writing this children’s book, I tried thinking about what I would have wanted to know when I was younger. I would have wanted to know that it’s ok to not be the best at something, or to be different from others. In this book, the main character, Benny, faces constant discouragement. Throughout the story, he visits many of his friends and challenges them to some sort of contest, and loses each one. He can’t jump rope better than a rabbit, knit faster than a cat, or be sillier than a goat. After a long day of competing with his friends, Benny arrives home in tears. His mother is able to comfort him, and says that he is the best Benny she knows, and just because we may fail at some things, doesn’t mean we are any less valuable. She reassures him that each of us has different strengths and weaknesses, and that’s what makes us unique. There are a few things that I would like the audience to get out of reading this book. I hope they know that they are special and not to compare themselves to others. I also hope they learn that it’s great to be different from your friends, and to not try to be anyone else but yourself.</p>
